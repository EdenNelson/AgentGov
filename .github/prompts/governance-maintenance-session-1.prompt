# Session 1: Governance Maintenance Scan & Suspect List Generation

## Objective

Scan all governance rules in the repository and produce an ADR-0001 style suspect list identifying rules that are (a) invalid, (b) superseded, (c) conflicting, or (d) token-wasting.

## Context

This is **Session 1 of a four-session governance maintenance workflow** documented in:
- [.github/adr/README.md](.github/adr/README.md) — ADR workflow overview
- [GOVERNANCE_MAINTENANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE_MAINTENANCE.md) — Multi-session governance process
- [ADR-0001](.github/adr/0001-establish-governance-adr-workflow.md) — Master plan

## Input

All governance and standards files in the repository:
- `STANDARDS_CORE.md`
- `STANDARDS_ORCHESTRATION.md`
- `STANDARDS_BASH.md`
- `STANDARDS_POWERSHELL.md`
- `GOVERNANCE_MAINTENANCE.md`
- `.cursorrules`
- `PERSONA.md` and `PERSONA_SCRIBE.md`
- `CONSENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- `SPEC_PROTOCOL.md`
- Any other governance-related files

## Process

1. **Scan all governance files** for rules and guidance that fall into these categories:
   - **Invalid:** Rules that refer to non-existent patterns, outdated frameworks, or impossible conditions
   - **Superseded:** Rules that overlap or are covered by other rules (deduplication opportunity)
   - **Conflicting:** Two or more rules that contradict each other
   - **Token Waste:** Rules that are overly verbose, redundant, or could be compressed without losing meaning

2. **Build a suspect list** with the following information for each candidate rule:
   - Rule/Section identifier (e.g., "STANDARDS_CORE.md §2.1")
   - Category (Invalid / Superseded / Conflicting / Token Waste)
   - Brief rationale (1-2 sentences)

3. **Create an ADR document** in `.github/adr/` with:
   - **Filename:** `0002-<rule-area>-governance-review.md` (e.g., `0002-standards-core-governance-review.md`)
   - **Status:** `Proposed`
   - **Date:** Today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - **Context:** Briefly describe the governance maintenance initiative
   - **Decision:** "Conduct governance review of [specific area] to identify problematic rules"
   - **Suspect List:** Table with Rule, Category, Rationale columns (see ADR_TEMPLATE.md for format)

## Output

A new ADR file in `.github/adr/` containing:
- ADR header with Status `Proposed`
- A Suspect List section with all identified problematic rules
- Each row documents a specific rule with its category and rationale

## Hand-Off to Session 2

Once this ADR is created and approved by the user:
1. User selects one suspect rule from the Suspect List
2. Session 2 agent takes ADR number and selected rule
3. Session 2 designs a "Probe" test per [GOVERNANCE_MAINTENANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE_MAINTENANCE.md) Step 2

## Stop Sequence

**CRITICAL:** After generating the ADR document:
1. Create the file
2. **STOP GENERATING IMMEDIATELY**
3. Do not proceed to Session 2
4. Do not make any further changes to governance files
5. Wait for user approval before proceeding

This enforces the SPEC_PROTOCOL hard gate between thinking (planning) and coding (implementation).

## Constraints

- **Do not alter governance files** — only create the ADR artifact
- **Do not proceed beyond suspect identification** — Session 2 will handle test planning
- **Protected files:** Do not modify STANDARDS_*.md, .cursorrules, or persona files
- **Preserve decision trail:** Reference this prompt and the master plan (ADR-0001) in the new ADR's context section

## Success Criteria

- ✓ New ADR created in `.github/adr/` with sequential numbering
- ✓ Status set to `Proposed`
- ✓ Suspect List includes at least 3 identified rules with clear categories and rationales
- ✓ No governance files were modified
- ✓ User has been asked for approval before Session 2 proceeds
